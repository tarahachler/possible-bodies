# Head of Lights
Head of Lights is an augmented reality game done with Unity for the [possible bodies](https://github.com/abstractmachine/head-md-possible-bodies) project at [HEAD Media Design](https://github.com/HEAD-MasterMediaDesign).

## Project Description
In this AR game, a disco ball is shining in the space you’re in. Suddenly, the lights and the music go off. The disco ball has lost its shine.
Your mission is to help it recover. To do that, you need to bring the light back, from the inside. You’re invited to enter the disco ball.
By using your gaze, turn on the stars, each one representing a light, and gradually restore the shared brightness. As you light up more stars, layers of the music return, step by step.
You will also shine more and more with the disco ball. When you finally turn all the lights back on, with the full music, the disco ball will shine again and leave your head.
